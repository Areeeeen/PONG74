Steps to run the simulation:

1. Open the file in Logisim Evolution software

2. Set the Auto-tick Frequency to either 2Hz or 4Hz (depending on how fast you can move the paddle manually with the mouse)

3. Press ctrl + k (Windows) or cmd + k (MacOS), to run the simulation.

4. Toggle the switches on the DIP switches to move the paddle (paddle movement will be handled using a potentiometer-resistorladder-comparator setup when made into a PCB)

P.S: The beta version does not have the feature of stopping the circuit when the paddle misses the ball. It will be added in v1 of the project.
